# Module 1: Time Series Programming Basics

The seven scripts in this module are designed to allow those with little or no programming experience to begin importing and manipulating the most common types of temporal data collected in behavioral research, event data and timeseries data. The scripts in this module will guide users through the basic processes of importing event data from csv files, indexing/slicing event and time series data in various ways, converting event data from/to time series data, etc.

Additionally, the first three scripts are designed to be run one line at a time to educate novice programmers, and the first two scripts contain practice problems with answers. Users who work through these scripts step-by-step will gain skills and confidence to combine and create variations of the provided scripts to accommodate their own data and research questions.

For novice users, we suggest working through scripts 1-4 in the order listed below, and using scripts 5-7 as needed for transforming exported event data into timeseries or spike train data formats for use in subsequent modules or other applications. 


Script 1: [programmingBasics.m](programmingBasics.m)

Script 2: [timeseriesBasics.m](timeseriesBasics.m)

Script 3: [eventDataBasics.m](eventDataBasics.m)

Script 4: [annotationImport.m](annotationImport.m)

Script 5: [convertEvents2Timeseries.m](convertEvents2Timeseries.m)

Script 6: [convertTimeseries2Events.m](convertTimeseries2Events.m)

Script 7: [convertEvents2Pointprocess.m](convertEvents2Pointprocess.m)


For all scripts below you will want to start MATLAB or Octave and navigate to the folder where the provided material (.M-functions and the data files) are located. That is, making MATLAB’s current folder equal to the folder to which you downloaded this module (e.g. ‘C:\\...\My Documents’). After this you can call these functions via the command line or the Matlab/Octave GUI.

**Script 1: *programmingBasics.m***

1. First, open the *programmingbasics.m* file using the matlab GUI. Run the following two lines to import the data into Matlab
```matlab
filename = fullfile('.', 'data', 'genericEventData.csv');
data_events = csvread(filename);
```

Hint: To run a line, you can highlight it in the script in Matlab and press F9 (keyboard) or "run selection" on the GUI. You can also copy-paste this line into the command line followed by ‘enter’. Note that all lines that begin with a % are “comments” meaning that they are there for documentation purpose. Matlab will not process them as part of the script. 

Here we use the function `fullfile()` to specify exact location and name of the data files. `Fullfile()` is a built-in function to build full file path name from parts (such as folder names and file names) with the file separator used in the operating system on each user's personal computer. Using this function allows the scripts to run on all types operating systems supported by Matlab and Octave. The first input argument, `'.'`, refers to the current directory.

You have just loaded an array *data_events* into the workspace. More specifically this is an 87 x 3 double array, meaning it has 87 rows and 3 columns and the values are all numeric. Each event is in its own row. The start times of the events are in column 1, the end times in column 2 and the type of event is in column 3. There are four types of events, each coded as a number between 1 and 4. If you go to your workspace you should now find a variable named csv_events_loc in it. If you double click this variable in the workspace Matlab will open a variable window that allows you to view the array. 

2. We will now begin accessing the data in this array. For example, to find out the start time of the third event, and store it in a new variable, you would run the line: 
```matlab
third_event_onset = data_events(3,1)
```

In general, the syntax for accessing (or referencing) array data and storing it as a new variable, is as follows: `name_of_variable_to_store = array_name(row, column)`. You can use this to access data from any row or column of *data_events*. You can try changing the numbers in the row and column positions to access other elements in the array, or changing the name of the variable to store another data element.

3. The next few lines show you more techniques for accessing multiple array element at once, such as: how to manipulate arrays by adding rows or columns, or by using simple algebra to shift array elements, how to use the size function to determine the size of your arrays, and how to write variables in your workspace to your computer. 

Try each and see what it does. 

Hint: The inline comments detail exactly what each line does. 

4. For more practice, there are a set of exercises at the bottom of the script. Try to do each on your own, and scroll down for the answers to each.


**Script 2: *timeseriesBasics.m***

1. Next, open the script called *timeseriesBasics.m*. We will also run this script line by line. Highlight and run the following lines: 
```matlab
% get to know the simple plot function
figure(1)
plot (1,1) 
plot (1,1, 'rs','MarkerSize',10)
```

The first line of the script will open a new window with a figure object, *Figure 1*. The second line plots a single data point at the position x=1 y=1 using the syntax `plot(xvalues, yvalues)`. However, as a single datapoint it is not visible on your plot. Therefore, in the third line we replot the datapoint at the same location specifying it as a redsquare `(‘rs’)` at size 10 `('MarkerSize',10)`. We will provide more information about these stylistic changes further later in this script. 

2. Now run lines the next lines to plot your first timeseries!
```matlab
% plot your first timeseries!
figure (1)
plot([1 2 3 4 5], [1 2 3 2 1])
```

Figure 1 should now contain a two lines in the shape of the top of a triangle. Again here we use the syntax `plot(xvals, yvals)`, but now, rather than providing a single datapoint, we provide a sequence of five *x* values and five *y* values as arrays of data, specifying five datapoints at (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and so on, i.e. five points at the (x,y) locations: (1,1) (2,2), (3,3) (4,2) and (5,1). The `plot(xvals, yvals)` function automatically connects the points into a line. 

Hint: if you would like to see the five points on the plot, run the lines under the comment `% add each datapoint as a red box`. The first line indicates to Matlab to draw on top of what is already plotted on Figure 1, rather than overwriting it. Line 18 plots the timeseries as a set of red square boxes.

3. Play with this simple timeseries to become familiar with the basic `plot(xvals, yvals)` syntax. To shift the datapoints so that the xvalues start at x = 6 rather than x = 1, edit your script as follows and rerun it: `plot([6 7 8 9 10], [1 2 3 2 1])`. To make the triangle steeper, edit your script as follows and rerun it: `plot([6 7 8 9 10], [1 4 9 4 1])`.

4. Now try a variation on the basic `plot(xvals, yvals)` syntax: `plot(yvals)` by running the following lines. 
```matlab
% try the syntax plot(yvals)
figure (2)
plot([1 2 3 2 1], 'bs','MarkerSize',10)
```

You should see the original triangle, now with blue squares. If you leave out the *xvals* array, Matlab assumes that the *xvals* start at 1 and increase by 1 for the length of *yvals*. 

5. Now we are ready to plot some actual data from a study! Highlight and run the following lines to open up two data files. 
```matlab
dataDir = fullfile('.', 'data');
saveDir = fullfile('.', 'data', 'outputs');

fnameG = fullfile(dataDir, 'InfGaze_P6_4mo.csv');
fnameH = fullfile(dataDir, 'InfHands_P6_4mo.csv');

%read face and hand data using csvread command
gazeData = csvread(fnameG);
handsData = csvread(fnameH);
```

You have just loaded two sets of timeseries data, *gazeData* and *handsData* into the workspace. Double click them in the workspace to view the data in the variable viewer. Each array contains three binary timeseries representing a single infants’ gaze *(gazeData)* or manual contact *(handsData)* with a set of three objects, annotated from a single session with a four-month-old infant. All annotations were completed by human coders labeling all changes at a rate of 10 frames / second (detailed in *de Barbaro, Johnson, Forster & Deak, 2016*, cited in main text). Each variable is a 3x1864 array (i.e. – three rows, 1864 columns), and each row indicates the precise moment that the infant was making contact (1 = contact, 0= no contact) with one of three objects (row 1 = object 1, row 2 = object two, row 3= object three). Note that time is not explicitly represented in this timeseries: given that datapoints are provided at regular intervals, the timing of the activity can be calculated simply by noting which column it occurs in. That is, each column represents a tenth of a second meaning that each 10 columns represent 1 second. 

6. To find out the duration of the coded session (in seconds), copy and paste the following line into your command window and hit return.
```matlab
size(gazeData,2)/10
```

Hint: review *programmingBasics.M* if you don’t remember how to use the size function, or how to store this value as a new variable in your workspace. Also, you can search for any matlab function online or the mathworks.com website to get more information about it including examples of how to run it. 

7. Now let’s begin plotting this data using the *timeseriesBasics.M* script. Run the following lines.
```matlab
%plot gaze to first object
figure(1)
plot(gazeData(1,:))    % plot(yvals)  % if time is regular across your datastreams you dont need to indicate timestamps/xvals
%set the plot title
title('Infant gaze: Object 1')
 
axis([0 size(gazeData,2) 0 1.5])                    
% axis([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX]) 
```

After opening a figure, the second line of the script plots the entire first row of the *gazeData* array (i.e. Gaze to Object 1) onto the figure using the syntax: `plot(yvals)`. The remaining lines add a title and adjust the axis to give the line a bit of white space as background. The syntax is `axis([XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX])`: an array with four values that specify the edges of the figure space using x-y coordinates. To add 10 seconds of additional buffer around the x axis, you can increase the *XMAX* value by running the line `axis([0 1964 0 1.5 ])` or, to if you want this to dynamically buffer based on the actual size of the array, use `axis([0 size(gazeData,2)+100 0  1.5]).

Looking at the figure itself, we can see a line that is zero until about frame 1000 and then bounces between 0 and 1 until about frame 1800, meaning that the infant was looking to and from object one between approximately 100-180 seconds. Remember, each frame is 1/10 a second and for each frame that the baby was looking to object 1, the timeseries will be 1, when it is not looking to object one, the timeseries will be 0. 

8. Run the following lines to plot gaze to all objects on a single plot. 
```matlab
% plot gaze to all objects on one plot 
figure(2)
plot(gazeData(1,:), 'r') 
hold on
plot(gazeData(2,:), 'g') 
plot(gazeData(3,:), 'c')    
title('Infant Gaze: three objects')
axis([0 size(gazeData,2)+100 0 1.5])
```

We can now see the pattern of the infant’s gaze across the entire session: infants first look back and forth at object 2 (in green), then object three (in blue) and lastly, object 1 (in red). This one-at-a-time pattern of gaze is very different from that of older infants, who rapidly alternate their gaze between multiple simultaneously available objects (see *de Barbaro, Johnson, Forster & Deak, 2016*). You can use the magnifying glass to zoom in on any aspect of the plot (note that you can specify horizontal or vertical zoom only as well). The next five sets of comments show you more options for changing aesthetic aspects of your plotted datapoints/timeseries, known as “line specification”.

9. Next, let’s run the following lines to plot gaze to all objects on a single plot. 
```matlab
% plot gaze and hands data together using two linked subplots
figure(5)
ax1 = subplot(2,1,1);    % syntax is subplot(total rows of plots, total 	columns of plots, position of current plot to be plotted)
plot(gazeData(1,:), 'r')
axis([0 size(gazeData,2)+100 0 1.5])
title('Looking at red toy')
 
ax2= subplot(2,1,2);
plot(handsData(1,:),'r')
axis([0 size(gazeData,2)+100 0 1.5 ])
title('Touching red toy')    %-----> try zooming in on one
```

You now have two plots within a single figure: one that indicates when infants look to the red object, and another that indicates when it touches or holds the red object. The `subplot` function is used to create multiple plots within a single figure with the syntax `subplot(total rows of plots, total columns of plots, position of current plot to be plotted)`. 	Thus, `subplot (2,1,1)` makes a space for two plots stacked on top of each other horizontally, and plots whatever data is specified in the next plot function in the first plot grid.  The code `subplot(2,1,2)` specifies that the second plot function i.e. `plot(handsData(1,:),'r')`, should be placed in the second position of the 2x1 plot grid. Try plotting another figure where there are two plots side by side by editing the subplot commands as follows: `subplot(1,2,1)` and `subplot(1,2,2)` columns. Finally, try zooming in on the gaze plot. Notice that the x axis of the two plots are not linked, one zooms in and the other stays zoomed out. Run the line `linkaxes([ax1,ax2],'x')`, to link the x axes of the plots. 

10. The lines prefaced by the comment `% generate and plot summed gaze and hands data` show you how to easily create and plot new timeseries that represent different ways of summarizing the data in your existing arrays. The lines after the `%save your plots` comment show you how to plot the most recently edited figure as a variety of image types.

11. Finally, try the exercises at the end of the script to practice and extend your new skills! Congratulations, you’ve graduated to the next script in the module!

**Script 3: *eventDataBasics.m***

1. Next, open the script called *eventDataBasics.m*. We will also run this script line by line. Highlight and run the following lines: 
```matlab
clear all
	
%use the simple plot function to plot a single line representing an event
figure (1)
plot([ 1 3], [ 2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)

%resize axis
axis([0 10 0 4])
```

The first line of the script cleans up your workspace, the second lines use the plot function to plot a single line representing an event. The plot syntax for drawing a single line -- how we will represent each event -- is an extension of the plot *(xvals, yvals)* syntax: `plot([x1 x2], [y1 y2 ])`, or, in plain English: `plot([event_onset event_offset], [vertical_axis_position vertical_axis_position ])`.
	
Your first plotted line begins at the point (1,2) and goes to the point (3,2) -- corresponding to a event that begins at second 1 and ends at second 3. It is plotted (somewhat arbitrarily!) in blue, at the vertical axis position of 2.

2.	Now let’s add some more events. Start by running the first set of three lines below. Observe your results, then run the second set.
```matlab
%add some more "events" to your plot, including some at different 	vertical positions
hold on
plot([ 5 6], [ 2 2] , 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
plot([ 2 6], [ 1 1], 'c', 'LineWidth',10 )

%add some more "events" to your plot in another color
plot([ 3.1 4.9], [ 2 2] , 'g', 'LineWidth',10)
plot([ 6.1 9.1], [ 2 2] , 'g', 'LineWidth',10)
plot([ 6.2 9.1 ], [ 1 1], 'g', 'LineWidth',10)
```

You can imagine that the top line (at the y = 2 position) indicates infant gaze data, and 	the bottom line (y=1 position) indicates infant touch data, with each color representing 	gazing at or touching a different object. In a few steps, we will plot real gaze and hand 	events. Note that when you are plotting events, you need to plot each event by drawing 	one line one at a time. It would be tedious to specify each line by hand for a large 	dataset. In the next step, we will practice looping through an array accessing and 	plotting data for each consecutive event. 

3.	Now let’s run the following set of lines, one section at a time. This time, we will plot the gaze data from a simple array formatted as an event data array.
```matlab
%create a gaze event array
gazeEvents  = [
		5,    6,    1 ;
		3.1 , 4.9 , 2 ;
		6.1 , 9.1 , 2 ];

%we can plot all the events in the array using a for loop
figure (2)
hold on
countRows = size(gazeEvents,1)
 
for currentRow = 1: 1: countRows
    plot(gazeEvents(currentRow,[1 2]), [2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
end
	
%resize axis
axis([0 10 0 4])
```

The first set of lines creates an array (gazeEvents) from scratch, that has each events in a new row, with start times in first column, stop times in the second column (in seconds) and the type of event in the third column (in this case, gaze events to object 1 or 2 ).

4. Check your workspace to see that your *countRows* variable has the value ‘3’, representing the number of rows in new *gazeEvents* array. The section beginning with *“for”….“end”* is called a **for loop**. Here, we create a variable called *currentRow* that begins with the value ‘1’, and in increments of 1 increases until it reaches the value of countRows (3). For each value of currentRow (i.e. 1-3), the script will run all of the lines between for and and – i.e. it will loop through to plot each event as specified in each of the three rows of the *gazeEvents* array!

Hint: To see how this happens, type the line *currentRow=1* into your command window and hit return. Then run the *gazeEvents(currentRow, [1 2])*. This is the equivalent of *gazeEvents(1, [1 2])* – i.e. *[5 6]*! You are telling Matlab to access the first two columns of the first row of the *gazeEvents* array (see your *programmingBasics* script for practice if this doesn’t make sense). So, the first time looping through the array, the line: 
```matlab
plot(gazeEvents(row,[1 2]), [2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
```

is read by matlab as:  
```matlab
plot([5 6], [2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
```

the second time, it is read as: 
```matlab
plot([3.1 4.9 ], [2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
```

and the third time, as: 
```matlab
plot([6.1 9.1 ], [2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
```
	
You can set *currentRow* to the value ‘2’ and then ‘3’ and rerun the command *gazeEvents(currentRow, [1 2])* to see this in action. 

5. Now try some variations on this main code by running the lines starting the comment `% lets try some simple variations!` And going through the complete for loop. Compare your results to those in Figure 2. If you run it as is, only one line that calls the *plot* function is active in the for loop. 

6.	You can see additional variations if you rerun this for loop lines after adding a `%` sign to the front of one of the other lines that calls the plot function (called “commenting out a line”) and removing the `%` sign from the next line of the script (called “uncommenting” a line). Do this for each of the four lines that call the plot function in the for loop. 

Hint: This is what you should be running the second time around.

```matlab
clf(3) % clear figure 3
figure (3)
axis([0 15 0 10])
hold on
countRows = size(gazeEvents,1);

for row = 1: 1: countRows
    
    % this shifts the events vertically up (y axis)
    % plot(gazeEvents(row,[1 2]), [ 7 7] , 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
    
    % this shift events forward in time by five seconds
     plot(gazeEvents(row,[1 2])+5, [ 2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
    
    % this puts the x axis in minutes rather than seconds
    % you will need to zoom in to see the event!
    % plot(gazeEvents(row,[1 2])/60, [ 2 2], 'c', 'LineWidth',10)
    
% this plots events in different horizontal positions on the y    % axis depending on their event type gazes to object 1 are              % plotted on the y=1 axis, gazes to object 2 are plotted on the  % y=2 axis,
% plot(gazeEvents(row,[1 2]), gazeEvents(row,[3 3]) , 'c',        % 'LineWidth',10)
    
end
```

**Script 4: *annotationImport.m***

1. Open up your script in matlab. This script transforms the outputs of annotation software commonly used in psychology, such as Elan, DataVyu, Noldus, or Mangold Interact into a more usable format that can be easily worked with within Matlab. It saves the transformed data as a csv file that can be imported by other scripts in this module or otherwise.  We’ll come back to the script in a moment. 

2. Open the file *mangold_3414goodman.csv* in your favorite spreadsheet viewer. This the raw exported annotation file from which we derived the data for Script 4. It contains labels for moment-to-moment changes in mother and infant affect. It comes from the software Mangold Interact. As with exports from other annotation software, this file contains many rows of data. Each row corresponds to a single event, and includes: onset and offset times as well as coding dimensions—in this case, MaternalAffect, InfantAffect, Maternal Problem Data, and Infant Problem data. In this file, maternal affect data is coded on a continuous numerical scale (ranging from -3 to +3) and infant problem data is coded categorically (withdrawal, neutral or positive, or W, N and P). Data exported from Annotation software typically contains column headers, which we will use to identify the annotations. this code is written for outputs where each participant's data is saved in a separate csv file. 

3. Lets take a look at a few aspects of the script in detail. Set a breakpoint in your script at the following line and then advance one step forward so that the script runs the line:  
```matlab
fname = fullfile(dataDir, ['mangold_' num2str(pID), 'goodman.csv']);
fid = fopen(fname, 'r');
pDataTable = textscan(fid, '%d %s %d %f %f %f %f %s %s %s', 'delimiter',',', 'headerLines', 1);
```

Here, we use the file read function *fopen()* and *textscan()* to import csvs with specified data types such as numbers and strings (ie letters and words). In Matlab versions 2017b and later, users can also use *readtable()* function to import csvs with multiple data types as tables with headers.

4. The goal of the rest of the code is to translate the data from the csv input file into a event type data format (i.e., matrix with three columns), and then store the event data as a csv for later processing.

5. Now let's fetch the onsets and offsets of the events first and use *cell2mat()* function to convert cell data into numerical matrix. Onset and offset timestamps are in column 4 & 5 in the original Mangold data files.
```matlab
pDataTime = cell2mat(pDataTable(:, 4:5));
```

6. Maternal affect codes are in column 7
```matlab
pDataMaternalCodes = cell2mat(pDataTable(:, 7));
```
 
7. For coded events that are text-based, i.e. those whose event data contain any letters or non-numeric symbols (such as Infant Affect and both Mother and Infant Problem data), we will convert them into event data with numerical values. For each annotation in pDataTable we will replace it with its corresponding numeric code, as follows:
```matlab
% 'A' (infant approach/ positive affect) -> +1
% 'N' (infant neutral affect) -> 0 
% 'W' ( infant withdrawal/ negative affect)  -> -1
```

8. To do this, we use Matlab built-in function *cellfun()* to go through each cell in the infant affect code column (column 10) and find cells with positive affect anntoations ('A') and convert them into numerical value 1.
```matlab
pDataInfant = pDataTable{:, 10};
maskInfantPos = cellfun(@(code) strcmp(code, 'A'), pDataInfant, 'UniformOutput', false);
maskInfantPos = vertcat(maskInfantPos{:});
pDataInfantCodes = nan(size(pDataInfant));
```

10.	Now with converted numerical values as infant affect codes, we can create infant affect events.
```matlab
eventsInfant = [pDataTime pDataInfantCodes];
```

11.	We can repeat the same process for other columns, such as MaternalProblemData column and InfantProblemData, in order to convert these data into event format. The users can just modify the column index number, the original text-based annotation and the corresponding numerical value. 

Lastly, we save the converted maternal and infant affect events as csv files:
```matlab
csvwrite(fullfile(dataDir, ['MaternalAffectEvents_',num2str(pID), '.csv']), eventsMaternal);
csvwrite(fullfile(dataDir, ['InfantAffectEvents_',num2str(pID), '.csv']), eventsMaternal);
```

**Script 5: *convertEvents2Timeseries.m***

1. This script and the rest of convert scripts, such as ***convertTimeseries2Events.m***, ***convertEvents2Pointprocess.m*** offer example scripts to convert one type of temporal data to another. 

This script converts event data into time series data and stores the output in the data folder. This is useful as some analyses require timeseries format. Note that this script will not work on raw unprocessed event data directly exported from common annotation software. This script is written to work with annotation software exports that have been processed via Script 5 *annotationImport.m*. Alternatively, they will work with any all-numeric event-data where individual events are stored in consecutive rows, and that include an onset and offset column and any coded dimensions in other columns. 

2. The script is set up to transform the infant affect events we worked with in ***annotationImport.m*** into time series data. 
```matlab
dataLabel = 'InfantAffect';
eventOnsetCol = 1; % indicate the event onset column
eventOffsetCol = 2;% indicate the event offset column
dataCol = 3; % indicate the column that has infant affect codes
 
% set sample_rate (the interval between two consecutive time stamps of converted timeseries data)
%.1 corresponds to 10fps  
% 0.034 corresponds to 29.97fps (common in US) 
%.04 corresponds to 25fps

sample_rate = .04;
```

Note: To modify the script to work with other data, change the data parameters in the indicated lines and the particulars of the filename details within the for loop looping through each participant.

3. Next, the script goes through a for loop to read events data from each participant, convert the events into time series and save the time series data into csv files under data folder.

4. Let's run the whole script and open one of the new timeseries csvs from the data folder. The first column is time in seconds, with the interval between timestamps determined by the *sample_rate* variable. Between the onset and the offset times for each event in the original datafile you should see the value corresponding to that affect state. Congratulations, you now have a timeseries!

**Script 6: *convertTimeseries2Events.m***

This script converts time series data into event data format and stores the output in the data folder. It follows the exact same process flow with the previous script, so we will omit the detailed explanation here. Detailed comments are provided in the script.

**Script 7: *convertEvents2Pointprocess.m***

This script converts event data into binary spike train data which is a specific type of time series data with only 1 or 0 as its categories. Because spike train data have only binary values (1 or 0) as its categories, for datastreams with multiple discrete event types users will need to specify the event category that they would like to have converted into. The logic flow is similar to the previous two scripts and detailed instructions can be found in the script.

In addition, because spike trains are a specific type of time series data, users can use ***convertTimeseries2Events.m*** if one needs to convert spike train data back to event data format.
